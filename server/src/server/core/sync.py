"""Yjs document sync: room lifecycle and channel filtering.

Each document is identified by its path within the vault (e.g. ``myvault/notes/foo.md``); the same string keys
both the on-disk file and the in-memory Yjs room. Markdown files on disk are the source of truth; the CRDT is
an ephemeral coordination layer that exists only while clients are connected.

A room's ``Y.Doc`` holds a single ``Y.Text`` named ``content``. Round-tripping is a pure string identity:
``read_file(...)`` seeds the text on first connect, ``str(text)`` writes it back on save.

The full lifecycle for each room — disk read on first connect, debounced saves while editing, save-and-drop on
last disconnect, save-all on shutdown — is owned by ``SyncManager``. One instance per app, constructed in
``create_app`` and stored on ``app.state.sync_manager``; route handlers look it up off the connection and call
``serve(channel)`` with a Channel-protocol object (any object with ``path``, ``__aiter__``, ``send``, ``recv``).

REST file writes bypass this layer entirely — they edit the ``.md`` directly. A REST write to a doc that has a
live room will be overwritten on the room's next save. Delete/rename endpoints therefore call ``close_rooms``
first, which drops any live room (disconnecting its clients) so it can't write the file back; as a backstop,
``_save_room`` refuses to save a doc whose ``.md`` no longer exists.
